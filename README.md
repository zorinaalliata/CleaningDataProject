The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

 CodeBook.md  describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

 run_analysis.R  contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio.
